# Youtubx 
In an effort to learn React, Redux and TypeScript, this is Youtubx, a simple Youtube client

It is built using React and Redux with Youtube API. It is developed with webpack and react-hot-loader and written with babeljs with the help of eslint.

See it in action at [faouzioudouh.github.io/youtube](https://faouzioudouh.github.io/youtube)

The intent of this project is to solidify my experience with these technologies and perhaps to inspire other developers in their journey with React and Redux.
